***********Handling Alerts in Selenium****************

What is an alert?
Alert is the popup message that you get on your application.
Alert takes the focus of our main screen/page.
We can not proceed until we have ndled this alert

Types of Alerts:
1. WebBased Alert/html Alerts: We can simply inspect them and deal with them in a regular way

2. Java Based alert - We can handle these alerts by using Alert Interface in selenium. Can't inspect Java alert
    How to deal with them?
        We use Alert interface to deal with them
        What is the approach to use alert interface?
            once the alert appears:
                Alert X=driver.switchTo.alert();
                x.Accept();
                x.Dismiss();
                x.SendKeys();
                x.getText();

3. Windows based alert - We cannot handle them in Selenium.

    No, we cannot

    1. driver.SwitchTo.frame();
    2.Then deal with that element;

    XXX) Techniques to switch to a frame:
    1. By Index; --> indexing starts from 0
    2. By name or Id --> the name and ID in the tag "as an attribute" <iframe name='frame1", id="abc">
