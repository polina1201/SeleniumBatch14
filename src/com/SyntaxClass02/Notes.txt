All the webapplication are developed using HTML

HTML --->

tags:

<html>             (html is a parent and body is a child. button is a grandchild/ancestro of html. body is parent of button)
    <body>
        <button> hello </button>
            <body>
                </html>

Every oppening tag, must have a closing tab

WebElement:
    Anything you see on a website is called a webElement


Some Common WebElements
1. Text Boxes
2. Radio Buttons
3. CheckBoxes
4. Calendars
5. Drop-Downs
6. Tables

Attributes
<button>My button</button>
text is written between the opening and closing tags.

<button class="abc", id="Butn">my button</button>
(1st button is tag. class is an attribute. "abc" is the value of the attribute class. "Butn" si the attribute of id)
Whatever we have inside the tag is callted attribute
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Locators:
Locators help us find a particular webElement on the page

-ID
-Name
-Tagname
-xpath
-linktext
-partialLinkText
-CSS Selector
-ClassName

The purpose of having multiple locators is because some tags might not have an Id (you can use any locator).
Two webElements have a common locator (e.g <input id="box", name="textbox"/>
                                        ,  <input id="box",class="btn")

--------------------------Anchor Tag--------------------------------------------------
<a> ---> anchor tag
usually the links are placed in this tag
if there is a text in the <a> tag, then you can use linktext locator.

NOSUCH ELEMENT EXCEPTION:
occurs when the Driver is unable to find the element on the page
1. the locator is wrong
2. the element is not on that page

if ID is available, always use id

--------------------DUPLICATE VALUES ATTRIBUTES------------------

<input id="box", name="Username"/>  --->Username box
<input id="box",class="Password"/> --->Password box

driver.findElement(By.id("box")).sendKeys("hello");

Driver is going to go in the DOM from top to bottom, the first tag with id box will be picked
and keys will be sent to that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. locators -->id, name, class, partialLinkText, linktext
2. linktext -->only when we have a link tag <a> and it has some text
3. partial and link text --> using partial u can enter just a part of the text
4. if there is numbers in the value of the locators, you should avoid it
5. No such element element -->1. the locator is wrong 2. the element is on the page
6. send the text and perform click operation
